**Why JSeeeDC?
It's just a university task, but you can use it to show children (or pupils) how big world of languages is.**

  * Why Distinguished?
Here is no number types. (But if you want to here is boolean, and 'if' operator. Use it ) and have a lot of fun.

  * Why compiler?
Some one may told that this program is just 'interpretor' whell, I use term from "Red Dragon Book".

  * What about?
Here's only three types: boolean, char, string.
Here's global and local scopes.
Here's 'if', 'while', 'repeat', 'forup' and other operators.
Here's functions, functions with different types.
It's strong typed language.
And many other details.

  * Gaven result?
  1. Error list. (if you make errors in code).
> 2. Genered result\_code.java (interpetted code to java language).

  * What More?
Look to current wiki.
